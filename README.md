# Hacking Huawei HG8012H ONT
## Steps to hack a HG8012H, access it and mod the firmware


Due to the change Pepephone ISP made last year migrating from Vodafone to Masmóvil's network, it was necessary for me to obtain an 802.1q-protocol compatible DSL router to be able to use the internet connection. This caused me to retire my Asus DSL-N55u router--which had a stability, configuration and WIFI coverage I was very happy with. So I purchased a Huawei HG556a DSL router and, since this router had a 10/100 switch and pretty mediocre WIFI speed, I also purchased a Linksys EA8500 router that would provide me with the WIFI coverage and gigabit connectivity for my devices. So I configured the Huawei HG556a router in WAN Bridge mode and connected it to the WAN port of the Linksys' router. This configuration gave me excellent performance, even more after flashing DD-WRT on the Linksys router.


Now, I have changed the internet operator, moving to a FTTH connection of 500/300 MB with Cableworld, and they installed a Huawei HG8245U router and an optical splitter whose coaxial output, connected to the house's main TV splitter, distributes the TV channels of the service. As I was very satisfied with the operation and WIFI coverage of the Linksys Ea8500 router, I configured the HG8245U router again in WAN bridge mode, and this is the way in which I have been working.

At that point several problems arised: the cableworld's HUWAEI router was huge and I lost some space in the living room furniture; the use of two devices (HUAWEI router and optical splitter) forced me to use two power plugs, which increased the entanglement of cables in general. In addition, this router had a high power consumption, which was a waste of resources, since I was not using any of its ethernet outputs (except 1 connected to the Linksys WAN router), its Wi-Fi, nor 90% of its features. So I started looking for an optical router/ONT with the following features: small sized, integrated CATV output, low power consumption and within the Huawei brand so it would be compatible with Cableworld's OLT. The perfect candidate was the Huawei HG8012H ,and in one of my trips to Portugal I was lucky enough to find one for 5€ in Cashconverters (shop price is about 80€).

### Hostility level 0

I got down to work configuring this ONT with my ISP parameters, so I connected an ethernet cable between the ONT and my PC and tried to open http://192.168.1.1 in browser, but I got no response. Then I searched the internet for Huawei documents and technical files and found that for this model, the default IP address is 192.168.100.1 and the access users are telecomadmin:admintelecom and root:admin. After making the relevant IP and subnet changes in the network card of my PC, I went to http://192.168.100.1 in the browser and 'voilà', the WebUi showed and, supposedly, I would be able to start configuring my brand new ONT:

Unfortunately, none of the two access users I had found in the documentation worked. So it occurred to me pressing the reset button for 30 seconds with a paper clip with the total certainty that this would cause the default access users to be functional again. But I was wrong. After a long time trying to search the internet for a login that would allow me access to the ONT, not only did I not find it but I verified that there is very little information about this device available. As if that were not enough, I discovered that when this ONT comes directly from an ISP, it is usually blocked by them as to not allow access to the configuration, and that way the user can not reuse it with another ISP. In this case, it appeared that the ONT that I bought in Cashconverters had not been purchased directly from HUAWEI, but instead had been installed by a supplier. Things started to get complicated.


### Hostility level 1

I could see that by entering 3 incorrect passwords, the router did not allow retry the login until 1 minute after, so the option of dictionaries and brute force attacks to access was discarded by the amount of time the entire process would take.

Normally many routers allow telnet access to the device as an alternative way of configuration, but in this case it was impossible and the connection closed due to lack of response from the ONT.

Trying to find some weak point in the ONT that allowed me access, I did a port scanner from my PC, with the following command:

nmap -Pn -n -p0- 192.168.100.1


It did not help much, all ports were closed except port 80 (webUi). Port 23 (telnet) was not only not open but was being filtered by the integrated firewall to further complicate things. There was nothing else I could do externally to solve this, so screwdriver in hand I ventured to examine the bowels of the bug.

### Hostility level 2

Once the cover was opened and after a component identification phase, this is what I found:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/5spec.jpg)

Of all these components the ones that caught my attention were the serial port pads, the JTAG port and the flash memory. After a search on the internet, I deduced the pinout of both the serial port and the JTAG. They are quite common among HUAWEI router devices.

I tested JTAG port using the parallel port cable that can be seen in the previous photo but I did not get response, so I focused my efforts on the serial port. After connecting a TTL-USB converter and connecting to the virtual COM port using PutTy with a rate of 115200 symbols, I started to see the following bootlog on the screen:

In many cases, this type of serial connection ends up in a login screen in which credentials are requested in order to operate and configure certain aspects of the device. However, this was not the case. No doubt this ONT was fortified so as not to alter its configuration in any way. In any case there was an information in the bootlog that caught my attention:

```console
Creating 11 MTD partitions on "hi_sfc":
0x000000000000-0x000000040000 : "startcode"
0x000000040000-0x000000080000 : "bootA"
0x000000080000-0x0000000c0000 : "bootB"
0x0000000c0000-0x000000100000 : "flashcfg"

0x000000340000-0x000000540000 : "kernelB"
0x000000540000-0x0000009c0000 : "rootfsA"
0x0000009c0000-0x000000e40000 : "rootfsB"
0x000000e40000-0x000000fc0000 : "file_system"
0x000000fc0000-0x000001000000 : "reserved"
```
Here you can see that the flash memory is subdivided into several partitions with different purposes. If in any of the partitions I could be able to locate the file with the current configuration of the router, I could modify it to suit my interests and even see the users enabled in the Webui, enable telnet or any other aspect. In many Huawei routers, the file in question is called 'hw_ctree.xml', which is precisely the file that is generated when exporting a configuration backup from the web administration. So, discarded the JTAG port and the serial port as access doors, there was only one option to focus all my attention: flash memory. I examined the serigraphed letters with a magnifying glass and I could see that it was a Spansion S25FL128P flash memory. So datasheet in hand I launched myself to scrutinize their interiors feeling that access to the router had already become a personal issue.

### Hostility level 3

To make a flash dump I found a specific utility for this type of flash chips called "Flashrom" that supports a large number of programmers. Luckily, I had one of them, a Microchip Pickit2 that I had forgotten in a drawer. So, with the pinout of the chip extracted from the datasheet, and the router completely disconnected from the power source (the programmer powers the chip itself) I started connecting the programmer to the chip with a SOIC16 clip (Pomona 5252). The connection schematic is as follows:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/8pickit2-pinout.jpg)

Once the programmer-chip connection was made, I connected the programmer to the USB port and made the flash dump by executing the command:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$sudo flashrom -p pickit2_spi -r flashdump.bin -c "S25FL128P......0"
```

with the parameter "-p" we specify the programmer we are using to read the flash memory, in my case as I mentioned it is a pickit2 and with the parameter "-c" we define the chip that we are going to read.
After about half an hour, the reading process ended and I already had the chip dump on my PC, ready to be examined.


![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/9connection.jpeg)

Once the flash memory has been dumped in a file, we must separate the file in their respective original partitions, in order to analyze each of them with greater precision. To do this, we first need to calculate the size of each partition, that is, subtract the offset from the end of the partition to the start offset of the partition. In this way, we obtain the following partition sizes:

```console
"startcode" : 0x000000000000-0x000000040000 =>  0x00040000 bytes
"bootA" : 0x000000040000-0x000000080000 => 0x00040000 bytes
"bootB" : 0x000000080000-0x0000000c0000 => 0x00040000 bytes
"flashcfg" : 0x0000000c0000-0x000000100000 => 0x00040000 bytes
"slave_param" : 0x000000100000-0x000000140000  => 0x00040000 bytes
"kernelA" : 0x000000140000-0x000000340000 => 0x00200000 bytes
"kernelB" : 0x000000340000-0x000000540000 => 0x00200000 bytes
“rootfsA" : 0x000000540000-0x0000009c0000 => 0x00480000 bytes
"rootfsB" : 0x0000009c0000-0x000000e40000 => 0x00480000 bytes
"file_system" : 0x000000e40000-0x000000fc0000 => 0x00180000 bytes
"reserved" : 0x000000fc0000-0x000001000000 => 0x00040000 bytes
```
And now we extract every partitión from the dump using the command:

```console
dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((PARTITION_START)) count=$((PARTITION_SIZE)) of=PARTITION_NAME.bin
```

In my case, these are the commands I ran:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00000000)) count=$((0x00040000)) of=1startcode.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00040000)) count=$((0x00040000)) of=2bootA.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00080000)) count=$((0x00040000)) of=3bootB.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x000c0000)) count=$((0x00040000)) of=4flashcfg.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00100000)) count=$((0x00040000)) of=5slave_param.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00140000)) count=$((0x00200000)) of=6kernelA.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00340000)) count=$((0x00200000)) of=7kernelB.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00540000)) count=$((0x00480000)) of=8rootfsA.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x009c0000)) count=$((0x00480000)) of=9rootfsB.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00e40000)) count=$((0x00180000)) of=Afile_system.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=flashdump.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x00fc0000)) count=$((0x00040000)) of=Breserved.bin
```

Note that at the beginning of each partition name I have added a sequence in the form of hexadecimal numbers to maintain the order of the partitions and thereby facilitate the subsequent task of joining them in a single file.

The configuration files that I am interested into to access the router's web as well as to enable other functions such as access via telnet reside in "AFile System.bin" partition. It is the partition that the router has with read and write permissions at runtime precisely to be able to save changes. If we think of a generic router in which we change for example the name of the WIFI network, the partition where that name is stored must have read and write permissions, because otherwise we could not modify the name of the WIFI ever.

To analyze the content of said partition "A", we will use a powerful and recognized tool to examine firmwares and dumps called "Binwalk" that will be of great help to us. But before launching it personally I always prefer to take a look at the hexadecimal content of what I am going to try to analyze and build a visual map of the data and the empty spaces. After opening the file with a hexadecimal editor I discover that the structure is like this:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/10fs_map.jpg)

We will separate each of these areas into separate files to facilitate the subsequent identification of each of the two data blocks as well as the future task of rebuilding partition "A". For this we use the dd command again:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=Afile_system.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x0)) count=12 of=Afile_system_trim1.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=Afile_system.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x100000)) count=493216 of=Afile_system_trim2.bin
```

At this point is when Binwalk comes into play, let's see what identifies in each of these two blocks that we just separated:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$binwalk Afile_system_trim1.bin

First file seems to be used only as an "identifier" of the format of the second one, because if I extract the file trim1 with the "-e" modifier of binwalk, no content appears. Certainly we can not expect many compressed files within a file of only 12 bytes in size. So for the moment we ignore that identifier.

Regarding the second file, binwalk identifies a chaos mixture of compressed files and JFFS2 file systems. This type of output is a clear indication that false positives are being detected. Let's help Binwalk a bit telling him to just try to identify JFFS2 file systems in Afile_system_trim2.bin, since I suspect that Zlib compressed files are included within the JFFS2 system itself:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$binwalk -y jffs2 Afile_system_trim2.bin

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             JFFS2 filesystem, little endian
```

Bingo!. This way Binwalk identifies the entire area as a single file system, so we can proceed to extract it and expect consistent results. We add the parameter "-e" to extract:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$sudo binwalk -y jffs2 -e Afile_system_trim2.bin
```

I have extracted the file system as superuser to make sure I don't lose sensible data like file permissions or symbolic links. IMPORTANT: Binwalk needs the 'jefferson' utility installed (https://github.com/sviehb/jefferson) in order to be able to extract this kind of file system. 
Inside the directory ./Afile_system_trim2.bin.extracted/jffs2-root we find the extracted files:

You can check highlighted in blue the necessary files needed to edit to vary webUi access parameters and router services while the files that must be edited to convert the ONT into a universal device, without personalization of the ISP are highlighted in pink. The problem with the firsts is that, in my case, if I open them with a text editor they turn out to be encrypted and their content is not understandable. Luckily this type of encryption has already been hacked by the community and there is a utility called "aescrypt2_huawei" that allows decryption and encryption of these file. We execute the following command on each of the files highlighted in blue to decrypt them:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$aescrypt2_huawei 1 INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE
```

The changes we need to make to the files after decrypting them are the following:

### Enable telnet access  
Before:
```console
TELNETLanEnable="0"
```
After:
```console
TELNETLanEnable="1"
```
### Set default Huawei routers users (root:admin and telecomadmin:admintelecom). Here we can see the credentials that the router was using until now (root:80%V0d@%W31%12)  
Before:
```console
<X_HW_WebUserInfo NumberOfInstances="1">
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="1" UserName="root" Password="80%V0d@%W31%12" UserLevel="1" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="1"/>
</X_HW_WebUserInfo>
```
After:
```console
<X_HW_WebUserInfo NumberOfInstances="2">
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="1" UserName="root" Password="admin" UserLevel="1" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="1"/>
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="2" UserName="telecomadmin" Password="admintelecom" UserLevel="0" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="0"/>
</X_HW_WebUserInfo>
```
In case that the password field is a string composed of hexadecimal characters it means that what is shown is not a clear password, but the result of applying a HASH function to it. To generate a hash with the desired password we must apply the function MD5 (PASSWORD) if the length of the original field is 28 bytes or the function SHA256 (MD5 (PASSWORD)) if the length of the field is 64 bytes. The file ./fs_1/CfgFile_Backup/V300R013C10SPC128B217.xml had the passwords in HASH format with 64 bytes in length in my ONT, so the access users section in that particular file was edited as follows:
After:
```console
<X_HW_WebUserInfo NumberOfInstances="2">
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="1" UserName="root" Password="465c194afb65670f38322df087f0a9bb225cc257e43eb4ac5a0c98ef5b3173ac" UserLevel="1" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="1" PassMode="2"/>
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="2" UserName="telecomadmin" Password="402931e04c03e24d360477a9f90b9eb15777e154360f06228be15c37679016ef" UserLevel="0" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="1" PassMode="2"/>
</X_HW_WebUserInfo>
```
If we want to the edit credentials for the Telnet user, we have to edit them in the "<X_HW_CLIUserInfoInstance" part of the XML file.

UPDATE: Seems that newer firmware versions have introduced a new hash format with salt. At this point I don't know how this new hash is generated, so it's not possible to set a password of our choice. You can identify this new hash type because, unlike previous hash methods, this one contains symbols and special-characters. A possible solution, not tested by me though, consist in setting hash and salt to a specific one, which should set 'admin' as password:  
```console
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="1" UserName="root" Password="$2$Q1Z9ex/9AP4}7.N*{7C~7jQAS8Oa.{96J1.Ra8T4fh;4Ac=uPFX:n5;8={QFlwW@p8|dTB#K><!Q"G"E7I0:=(Ro%9jEq"_-/|T$" UserLevel="1" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="1" PassMode="3" Alias="cpe-1" Salt="4d28bdd0cf559f6a0c8c5467"/>
<X_HW_WebUserInfoInstance InstanceID="2" UserName="telecomadmin" Password="$2$Q1Z9ex/9AP4}7.N*{7C~7jQAS8Oa.{96J1.Ra8T4fh;4Ac=uPFX:n5;8={QFlwW@p8|dTB#K><!Q"G"E7I0:=(Ro%9jEq"_-/|T$" UserLevel="0" Enable="1" ModifyPasswordFlag="1" PassMode="3" Alias="cpe-2" Salt="4d28bdd0cf559f6a0c8c5467"/>
```
This (in theory) sets root/admin and telecomadmin/admin credentials
  
### Set local ONT's IP according to my LAN
Before:
```console
IPInterfaceIPAddress="192.168.100.1"
```
After:
```console
IPInterfaceIPAddress="192.168.1.1"
```

### Debranded configuration, from "Vodafone Portugal" (PTVDFB) to "Universal device"
Before:
```console
<X_HW_ProductInfo originalVersion="V300R013C10SPC128C0009150076" currentVersion="V300R013" customInfo="PTVDFB" customInfoDetail="PTVDFB"/>
```
After:
```console
<X_HW_ProductInfo originalVersion="V300R013C10SPC128C0009150076" currentVersion="V300R013" customInfo="COMMON" customInfoDetail="COMMON"/>
```

### Disable DHCP LAN Server. This was caussing issues in the WAN port of my Linksys EA8500
Before:
```console
<LANHostConfigManagement DHCPServerConfigurable="1" DHCPServerEnable="1"
```
After:
```console
<LANHostConfigManagement DHCPServerConfigurable="1" DHCPServerEnable="0"
```

Now we have to do the reverse step with these files, that is, re-encrypt them and replace the original files with the new ones that we have modified. To re-encrypt the modified files we use the command:
```console
aescrypt2_huawei 0 INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE
```

Now we focus on the files we marked in pink on the JFFS2 file system tree. These files are not encrypted, so its modification is much easier. As I explained previously, what we are looking for by editing them is to establish with it the ONT as universal without the personalization, in this case, of Vodafone Portugal. These are the changes we need to make:

hw_boardinfo BEFORE:
```console
obj.id = "0x0000001b" ; obj.value = "PTVDFB";
```

The script pointed by "recovername" is used when pressing the reset button for 30 seconds. In my case PTVDFB uses the same reset script as the universal ONT, but other ONTs with different customizations from other ISPs may use a different script (Ex: recover_claro.sh). If that's the case, we should modify the "recovername" file to set "recover_common.sh" as reset script.

Here we have finished all the modifications of the JFFS2 file system, what we have to do now is to repack everything again. The commands that we need to execute are:     
Pack the JFFS2 file system:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$mkfs.jffs2 -l -q --root=./Afile_system_trim2.bin.extracted/jffs2-root/fs_1 -o new_jffs2.bin
```
Create an 'empty' container filled with "FF" to build a new "Afile_system_MODDED.bin" with our changes, keeping the original size of Afile_system.bin:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=$((0x00180000)) | tr "\000" "\377" > Afile_system_MODDED.bin
```
Insert the "identifier" we split before in the new container in its original offset (0):
```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=Afile_system_trim1.bin bs=1 status=none of=Afile_system_MODDED.bin conv=notrunc
```
Insert the new JFFS2 file system in the new container in its original offset (0x100000):
```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=new_jffs2.bin bs=1 status=none seek=$((0x100000)) of=Afile_system_MODDED.bin conv=notrunc
```
Rebuild the whole flash, using our Afile_system_MODDED.bin instead of the original "A" partition:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$cat 1startcode.bin 2bootA.bin 3bootB.bin 4flashcfg.bin 5slave_param.bin 6kernelA.bin 7kernelB.bin 8rootfsA.bin 9rootfsB.bin Afile_system_MODDED.bin Breserved.bin > fullflash_MODDED.bin
```

With this we have created the file "fullflash_MODDED.bin" that contains all the partitions that the Huawei ONT needs to work. What we have to do with it is to burn it into the ONT's flash and check if the modifications we made do work. So, we reconnect the programmer (Pickit2 in my case) to the flash chip using the SOIC16 clip and execute:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$sudo flashrom -p pickit2_spi -w fullflash_MODDED.bin -c "S25FL128P......0"

## Time for truth

We connect the router to the power source, the ONT to our LAN and we go to the address http://192.168.1.1:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/12login.png)

Enter the superuser credentials we established in config files (telecomadmin / admintelecom) and click "LOGIN":

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/13welcome.png)

We did it !!! We have managed to access the webui starting from a completely unknown user access and password situation (which was not re-established even with a hard-reset of the device) and with blocked telnet access. Will we be able to connect also via telnet? Let's see:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/14telnet.png)

Yes! I used root:admin credentials for Telnet access, if we wanted to modify these credentials, we could have done it by editing the section <X_HW_CLIUserInfoInstance in the XML files. The Telnet console gives us access to the Huawei WAP console, which is a console with custom commands to set different configurations. Not to be confused with a standard BASH console in linux, here we can not use "dir", "mkdir" or any linux console command.

At this point I only need to configure the SN of the router HG8245U that my ISP installed, in this hacked HG8012H ONT. The SN of the router is used as an identification parameter and access restriction to the Internet network of the ISP. With an SN that is not previously registered in the whitelist of the internet operator's OLT, the router will never do synchronize with ISP. So we must configure the SN of the router HG8245U in the ONT HG8012H going to the menu "System Tools"> "ONT Authentication" and clicking "Apply" after entering the SN.


After this, I notice that the LED PON flashes in green a few seconds and finally remains fixed in that same color, that is, the ONT has managed to authenticate in ISP's OLT. At the same time, I observe that on my Linksys EA8500 router I get a public IP, so finally I have my Internet connection working, occupying much less space in the furniture and consuming less energy.

## ¿THE END?

Not yet. When I turn on my TV I realise no TV channels are visible at all and the CATV LED on the ONT remains off. At first I imagined that connecting a coaxial cable to the CATV output will turn on the CATV LED, but it was not like this. I also I did not see any option in the web interface to activate said television output. Why? It seems that the system is designed in this way: just after the ONT synchronizes with the OLT, the OLT sends the order to activate the TV module in the routers of clients that have contracted that TV service. If a client has not contracted the TV service, then the OLT will not send the instruction to activate said CATV module and therefore the client will not be able to see the TV through said output. In my case, I have contracted the TV service with ISP, but they use a passive device to extract the television channels from the optical fiber (Mininode SR2020AW, see first pic in top of this article) so the OLT sends by default the CATV = Off instruction to the subscribers, as in this ISP there's no client with an ONT with CATV integrated in.

After colliding with the wall of lack of information about the CATV module integrated in some of the Huawei devices and multiple tests, I finally discovered a way to activate the TV in the ONT:

```console
telnet 192.168.1.1
Login: root
Password: admin
WAP> su
SU_WAP> set rf switch on
```

These commands must be entered AFTER the ONT synchronizes with the OLT. If we execute it before the synchronization, the CATV module will turn off again after synchronization since as we said, the OLT of my ISP sends the instruction CATV = Off by default.

The disadvantages of activating the CATV module in this way are clear: each time the ONT power source turns off, voluntarily or involuntarily, the CATV module will remain OFF until the Ethernet cable that goes from the ONT to the WAN port of the Linksys router is disconnected, and the cable coming from my PC is connected to the ONT and then the previous Telnet commands are run. And after this, all the cables should be connected as they were to be able to have an internet connection again. Not very practical, we have to somehow automate the activation of the television output, and this involves modifying the firmware even more.

What we now want to achieve is not to edit the configuration of the device (as we did with the partition "A"), but modify the internal operation of the device itself. This will be achieved by editing the root file system (ROOTFS), that is partition "8" and "9" according to the map initially shown. With a simple comparison of crc32 I verify that 8rootfsA.bin is identical to 9rootfsB.bin, so I will focus on 8rootfsA.bin. As we did in the past, I now make a data map of partition "8":

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/15rootfs_map.jpg)


It seems that all the information in this partition is condensed in the upper part, without intermediate gaps, so in principle we are not going to perform additional separations. Let's see what binwalk detects:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$binwalk  8rootfsA.bin
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
84            0x54             uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0xEADB737A, created: 2016-04-18 13:19:13, image size: 3805184 bytes, Data Address: 0x0, Entry Point: 0x0,data CRC: 0xE731B6C3, OS: Linux, CPU: ARM, image type: RAMDisk Image, compression type: none, image name: "squashfs"
148           0x94             Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression:lzma, size: 3802857 bytes, 1005 inodes, blocksize: 131072 bytes, created: 2016-04-18 13:19:13
4504532       0x44BBD4         MySQL ISAM index file Version 6
```
From here we can deduce several things with very simple calculations. First Binwalk detected a header of type Uimage at offset 0x54, but the data according to the previous map started directly at offset 0. This means that before the uimage header we have some type of header not identified by Binwalk. We will call that piece between offset 0x00 and 0x54 "Huawei_header". Then there is an lzma compressed Squashfs v4.0 file system. Third, there is a structure of MySQL type ISAM at offset 0x44BBD4. If we observe the data detected by Binwalk in the Uimage header, one of them tells us that the squashfs system with which this header is associated has a size of 3805184 bytes, while the size that Binwalk has detected in the squashfs system itself is 3802857 bytes. This means that Binwalk has incorrectly identified the squashfs system length: the squashfs system does not end at 0x3A077D (0x94 + 3802857 = 0x94 + 0x3A06E9 = 0x3A077D) but at offset 0x3A1094 (0x94 + 3805184 = 0x94 + 0x3A1000 = 0x3A1094). Next there are unidentified data that ends at offset 0x47C228. Binwalk is not able to identify it even after extracting the section [0x3A1094 0x47C228]. We will call this part "Huawei_footer.bin" and will add it at the end of the 8rootfsA_MODDED.bin repackage process. With all this, we can fine-tune the initial map of 8rootfsA.bin and it would look like this:


![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/16rootfs_map2.jpg)


UPDATE: After some tests updating HG8012H firmware I understood that there's no "Huawei_footer" at all in partition "8", this data was in fact remains of older and bigger squahfs file systems. When one rootfs update takes place via an official firmware update, the unused space that goes from squashfs end to partition "8" end doesn't get formatted to "FF....", so we can assume that this Huawei_footer garbage is empty space like the next area is. Then we can show partition "8" structure as:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/21rootfs_map3.jpg)

We proceed to split each area using dd:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=8rootfsA.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x0)) count=84 of=8rootfsA_Huawei_header.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=8rootfsA.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x54)) count=64 of=8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=8rootfsA.bin bs=1 status=none skip=$((0x94)) count=3805184 of=8rootfsA_squashfs.bin
```
And we extract the squashfs file system with binwalk:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$binwalk -e 8rootfsA_squashfs.bin
```

The directory tree extracted at./8rootfsA.bin.extracted/squashfs-root is the following: (IMPORTANT: in order for binwalk to extract this type of file system we need to have 'squashfs-tools' package installed in our system)

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/17squashfs_tree.png)

We are going to edit the file ./8rootfsA.bin.extracted/squashfs-root/etc/rc.d/rc.start/1.sdk_init.sh, which is the last script that is executed during the boot of the device, to invoke a new script that will allow us to invoke the process that will activate the CATV output as well as execute other commands that we may need in the future, without risk of breaking the 1.sdk_init.sh file in future editions. So I insert the following two lines in the final part, just before the infinite processes:

```bash
#echo -n "Activate CATV output"
/bin/start_CATV.sh &
```
![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/18editrc.png)

Then we create a file called "start_CATV.sh" in "/bin/" and insert the following lines inside:

```bash
#/bin/sh

#wait to boot
sleep 80

#set catv output on
{ sleep 1; echo ""; sleep 3; echo "root"; sleep 3; echo "admin"; sleep 3; echo "su"; sleep 3; echo "set rf switch on"; sleep 3; echo "quit"; sleep 3; echo "quit"; } | console.sh
```

The 80-second timeout is to make sure that the ONT has finished booting and synchronizing with the ISP. The next line launches a local telnet session, which connects to the Huawei WAP console and writes line by line the necessary text to activate the CATV output.

Set exec permissions to "start_CATV.sh":
```console
logon@logonlap:~$chmod +x start_CATV.sh
```

Once this is done, it's time to repack the squashfs system. For this we will need the mksquashfs utility with support for LZMA compression compiled in (mksquashfs belongs to the squashfs-tools package, but in ubuntu repositories this utility is not compiled with LZMA compression enabled. You can locate the binary with the LZMA compression enabled in the "Files" section of this project). We pack with the command:

```console
logon@logonlap:~$sudo mksquashfs ./8rootfsA.bin.extracted/squashfs-root/ new_squashfs.bin -comp lzma -all-root
```

Both the Uimage header and the Huawei header have some CRC32 checks that we must patch so that the file system is recognized as valid by the router, so we will need to execute the following commands and write down the output generated:  

new_squashfs.bin CRC32:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$crc32  new_squashfs.bin
```

new_squashfs.bin length (4 bytes format):
```console
logon@logonlap:~$printf '%08x\n' $(stat -c '%s' new_squashfs.bin)
```
Open the file 8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin with an hexadecimal editor and search for the sequence "27 05 19 56 UU UU UU UU VV VV VV VV WW WW WW WW XX XX XX XX YY YY YY YY ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ". We must replace "ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ" with the CRC32 of new_squashfs.bin and "WW WW WW WW" with the length of the new_squashfs.bin file. Once this is done, we modify the sequence "UU UU UU UU" with "00 00 00 00" and save the file.  


8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin CRC32:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$crc32 8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin
```
Now we reopen 8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin and replace again the last sequence "00 00 00 00" that we added to replace "UU UU UU UU" with the CRC32 obtained in the last command.  

Join  8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin and new_squashfs.bin:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$cat 8rootfsA_Uimage_header.bin new_squashfs.bin > 8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin
```

Now we create a 8-byte sequence concatenating the output of the following two comands:  
8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin length (4 bytes format) reversed by 2:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$printf '%08x\n' $(stat -c '%s' 8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin) | fold -w2 | tac | tr -d "\n"; echo ""
```

8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin CRC32 reversed by 2:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$crc32 8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin | fold -w2 | tac | tr -d "\n"; echo ""
```


We now open the file 8rootfsA_Huawei_header.bin with an hexadecimal editor and modify exactly its last 8 bytes with the concatenated string we just created.  

Join 8rootfsA_Huawei_header.bin and 8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin into a single file:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$cat 8rootfsA_Huawei_header.bin 8rootfsA_UH_SFS.bin > 8rootfsA_nopad.bin
```

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/19checks.png)

We already have the partition almost rebuilt, we just have to add "FF..." to complete all the size the partition "8" had initially. Create the FF container with all the required size:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=$((0x00480000)) | tr "\000" "\377" > 8rootfsA_MODDED.bin
```

Insert our modded "8" partition in the container in the original position (offset 0):
```console
logon@logonlap:~$dd if=8rootfsA_nopad.bin bs=1 status=none of=8rootfsA_MODDED.bin conv=notrunc
```
The last step of reconstruction is to merge all the partitions into a single file. As we said at the beginning that "8rootfsA.bin" was a 1:1 copy of "9rootfsB.bin", I add the first twice:
```console
logon@logonlap:~$cat 1startcode.bin 2bootA.bin 3bootB.bin 4flashcfg.bin 5slave_param.bin 6kernelA.bin 7kernelB.bin 8rootfsA_MODDED.bin 8rootfsA_MODDED.bin Afile_system_MODDED.bin Breserved.bin > fullflash_MODDED.bin
```
Repeat the process of programming this dump in the flash chip using Flashrom (as we did with the first modification of the partition "A"). Turn on the router and:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logon84/Hacking_Huawei_HG8012H_ONT/blob/master/pics/20catvon.jpg)

The CATV module starts automatically and I can see the channels on TV.

This is all, I suppose that this whole process can be easily adapted to other router models to carry out certain modifications. I hope you found the tutorial interesting. Thanks for reading. Logon
